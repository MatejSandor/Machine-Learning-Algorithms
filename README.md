# Machine Learning Algorithms
Implementation of Popular Machine Learning Algorithms. These algorithms were implementing using only in-built Python modules and NumPy.

## Usage

This repository was created for people to see and be able to learn machine learning algorithms.
The implementations are not fully optimised just so the implementation remains logical and simple. 

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
